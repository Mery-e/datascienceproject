"Ronald Ellwin Evans Jr. (November 10, 1933 – April 7, 1990) was an American electrical engineer, aeronautical engineer, officer and aviator in the United States Navy, and NASA astronaut. As Command Module Pilot on Apollo 17 he was one of the 24 astronauts to have flown to the Moon, and one of 12 people to have flown to the Moon without landing on it. Before becoming an astronaut, Evans graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Kansas and joined the U.S. Navy in 1956. After receiving his naval aviator wings, he served as a fighter pilot and flew combat missions during the Vietnam War. In 1964 he received a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Achieving the rank of captain, he retired from the Navy in 1976. Evans was selected as an astronaut by NASA as part of NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966 and made his only flight into space as command Module pilot aboard Apollo 17 in December 1972, the last crewed mission to the Moon, with Commander Gene Cernan and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt. During the flight, Evans and five mice orbited the Moon a record 75 times as his two crewmates descended to and explored the surface. He is the last person to orbit the Moon alone and, at 147 hours and 43 minutes, holds the record for the most time spent in lunar orbit. During Apollo 17's return flight to Earth, Evans performed an extravehicular activity (EVA) to retrieve film cassettes from the service module. It was the third ""deep space"" EVA, and is the spacewalk performed at the greatest distance from any planetary body. As of 2022, it remains one of only three deep space EVAs, all made during the Apollo program's J-missions. It was also the final spacewalk of the Apollo program. In 1975, Evans served as backup Command Module Pilot for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project mission.

Carpenter was the second American (after John Glenn) to orbit the Earth and the fourth American in space, after Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, and Glenn. Commissioned into the U.S. Navy in 1949, Carpenter became a naval aviator, flying a Lockheed P-2 Neptune with Patrol Squadron 6 (VP-6) on reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare missions along the coasts of Soviet Union and China during the Korean War and the Cold War. In 1954, he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and became a test pilot. In 1958, he was named Air Intelligence Officer of USS Hornet, which was then in dry dock at the Bremerton Navy Yard. The following year, Carpenter was selected as one of the Mercury Seven astronauts. He was backup to Glenn during the latter's Mercury Atlas 6 orbital mission. Carpenter flew the next mission, Mercury-Atlas 7, in the spacecraft he named Aurora 7. Due to a series of malfunctions, the spacecraft landed 250 miles (400 km) downrange from its intended splashdown point, but both pilot and spacecraft were retrieved. Carpenter obtained permission from NASA to take a leave of absence to join the U.S. Navy SEALAB project as an aquanaut. During training he suffered injuries that grounded him, making him unavailable for further spaceflights. In 1965, he spent 28 days living on the ocean floor off the coast of California as part of SEALAB II. He returned to NASA as Executive Assistant to the Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center, then joined the Navy's Deep Submergence Systems Project in 1967 as Director of Aquanaut Operations for SEALAB III.

"William Barton Bridgeman (June 25, 1916 – September 29, 1968) was an American test pilot who broke aviation records while working for the Douglas Aircraft Company, testing experimental aircraft. In July 1951, the United States Navy announced the D-558-II Skyrocket piloted by Bridgeman had ""attained the highest speed and altitude ever recorded by a piloted plane"". On August 15 of the same year, he set a world record with a speed of Mach 1.88 and an unofficial record height of 79,494 feet (24,230 m). Bridgeman was born in Ottumwa, Iowa. His father was a barnstormer and separated from his mother shortly after he was born. He was raised in Malibu, California by his paternal grandmother and majored in geology in college, receiving his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of California. He enlisted in the United States Navy to attend flight school at Pensacola. He graduated and was commissioned in 1941, and was sent to Pearl Harbor, where he experienced the Japanese attack on December 7. He flew PBY flying boats in the New Guinea/Australia sector, then four-engined PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol bombers on a tour of operations with VP/VPB-109 (the ""Reluctant Raiders""). He was reassigned afterwards to training activities stateside from August 1944 until the end of the war, then spent two years flying transport missions from Pearl Harbor to the West Coast. Upon leaving the Navy in 1947, Bridgeman joined Southwest Airways (a local West Coast airline that eventually became Pacific Air Lines, not to be confused with today's Southwest) to fly DC-3s on the San Francisco-Seattle route. Bored with the airline routine, he left in 1949 to join Douglas as a production test pilot to certify A-1 Skyraiders off the assembly line before their delivery to the Navy. A few months later, he accepted an offer to take over the test program of the D-558 II Skyrocket, one of the world's first supersonic research aircraft. Bridgeman converted to jet aircraft on the F-80 in early 1950 and eventually conducted a very successful test program with the Skyrocket, collecting data on the behavior of swept-wing aircraft over a wide envelope of load factors and Mach numbers deep in the supersonic range. In May 1951, he broke the world speed record, achieving a speed of Mach 1.72, then broke the record again, reaching Mach 1.88 (1,245 mph, 1,992 km/h) the next month. Immediately afterwards, he broke the world altitude record with 79,494 ft (24,230 m) on the Skyrocket's final flight before delivery to NACA. During this campaign, Bridgeman was one of the first pilots to encounter the phenomenon of inertia coupling, a flight hazard that would dominate high-speed aircraft research for much of the 1950s. He was on the cover of the April 27, 1953, Time magazine. He appeared as a contestant on the You Bet Your Life radio program on October 29, 1952. He went on to fly other Douglas test programs including the X-3 Stiletto, a promising but ultimately unsuccessful design. In 1955, he recounted his experiences test-flying the Skyraider and Skyrocket in a successful memoir, The Lonely Sky, written with Jacqueline Hazard, whom he married shortly after the book was published. He was an astronaut candidate for the United States Air Force Man In Space Soonest program, but the program was cancelled on August 1, 1958, and replaced by NASA's Project Mercury. Bridgeman eventually moved to Grumman Aircraft where he conducted test programs of commercial aircraft, then pursued a career in commercial real estate. In September 1968, he was the pilot of a routine air-taxi flight from Los Angeles to Santa Catalina Island when his Grumman Goose amphibian went down in the Pacific Ocean.

"David Randolph Scott (born June 6, 1932) is an American retired test pilot and NASA astronaut who was the seventh person to walk on the Moon. Selected as part of the third group of astronauts in 1963, Scott flew to space three times and commanded Apollo 15, the fourth lunar landing; he is one of four surviving Moon walkers and the last surviving crew member of Apollo 15. Before becoming an astronaut, Scott graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and joined the Air Force. After serving as a fighter pilot in Europe, he graduated from the Air Force Experimental Test Pilot School (Class 62C) and the Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class IV). Scott retired from the Air Force in 1975 with the rank of colonel, and more than 5,600 hours of logged flying time. As an astronaut, Scott made his first flight into space as a pilot of the Gemini 8 mission, along with Neil Armstrong, in March 1966, spending just under eleven hours in low Earth orbit. He would have been the second American astronaut to walk in space had Gemini 8 not made an emergency abort. Scott then spent ten days in orbit in March 1969 as Command Module Pilot of Apollo 9, a mission that extensively tested the Apollo spacecraft, along with Commander James McDivitt and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart. After backing up Apollo 12, Scott made his third and final flight into space as commander of the Apollo 15 mission, the fourth crewed lunar landing and the first J mission. Scott and James Irwin remained on the Moon for three days. Following their return to Earth, Scott and his crewmates fell from favor with NASA after it was disclosed that they had carried four hundred unauthorized postal covers to the Moon. After serving as director of NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in California, Scott retired from the agency in 1977. Since then, he has worked on a number of space-related projects and served as a consultant for several films about the space program, including Apollo 13.",Astronauts,"[('Ann Kim', 'PERSON'), ('James Beard Award', 'PERSON'), ('Minneapolis', 'GPE'), ('Minnesota', 'GPE')]","[('Ann Kim', 'PERSON'), ('James Beard Award', 'ORG'), ('Minneapolis', 'GPE'), ('Minnesota', 'GPE')]"

Whitson has a total of 665 days in space, more than any other woman or American. Her first space mission was in 2002: an extended stay aboard the International Space Station as a member of Expedition 5. On her second mission, Expedition 16, she became the first woman to command the ISS. In 2009, she became the first woman to serve as NASA's Chief Astronaut, the most senior position in the NASA Astronaut Corps. In 2017, Whitson became the first woman to command the International Space Station twice. Her 289-day flight was the longest single space flight by a woman until Christina Koch's 328-day flight. Whitson holds the records for the oldest woman spacewalker and the most spacewalks by a woman. Whitson's cumulative EVA time is 60 hours, 21 minutes, which places her in fifth place for total EVA time. At age 57 on her final flight, she was the oldest woman ever in space at that time, and remains the oldest to fly in Earth orbit. On June 15, 2018, Whitson retired from NASA.

Conrad was selected in NASA's second astronaut class in 1962. Conrad had dyslexia and yet earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Princeton University—being the first Ivy League astronaut—and joined the U.S. Navy. In 1954 he received his naval aviator wings, served as a fighter pilot and, after graduating from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (Class 20), as a project test pilot. In 1959 he was an astronaut candidate for Project Mercury. Conrad set an eight-day space endurance record in 1965 along with his Command Pilot Gordon Cooper on his first spaceflight, Gemini 5. Later, Conrad commanded Gemini 11 in 1966, and Apollo 12 in 1969. After Apollo, he commanded Skylab 2, the first crewed Skylab mission, in 1973. On the mission, he and his crewmates repaired significant launch damage to the Skylab space station. For this, President Jimmy Carter awarded him the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. After Conrad retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, he became a vice president of American Television and Communications Company. He went on to work for McDonnell Douglas, as a vice president. During his tenure, he served as vice president of marketing, senior vice president of marketing, staff vice president of international business development, and vice president of project development.

"Prof. Dr. Reinhard Alfred Furrer (25 November 1940 – 9 September 1995) was a German physicist and astronaut. Furrer was born in Wörgl, Ostmark (now Austria). After the end of World War II, his father was expelled from Austria. The family found a new home in Kempten im Allgäu, Bavaria. Furrer stayed there until he joined the University of Kiel to study physics. He later transferred to the Free University of Berlin, where he received a diploma in 1969, and a doctorate in 1972. During his time as a student in Berlin, he was involved in the building of the 145 m long ""Tunnel 57"" below the Berlin Wall, which was the escape route of 57 people from East Berlin to the West. In 1974 he became assistant professor in Stuttgart and in 1979 qualified for full professorship. He spent time during 1980–1981 at the University of Chicago and during 1981 at the Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, USA. In 1977 Furrer applied for selection as an astronaut for the first Spacelab mission. He made it into the final round of candidates, although Ulf Merbold was finally selected. In 1982, the astronauts for the first German Spacelab mission were selected from the finalists for the first mission, and Furrer was one of the two chosen. He was a payload specialist on STS-61-A (D1), which was launched on 30 October 1985. The other payload specialists on the flight were Ernst Messerschmid and Wubbo Ockels (Netherlands). Furrer wore the Sinn (watchmaker) model 140 S on his wrist during the STS-61-A mission in 1985 After his spaceflight he became a professor in 1987 as well as the Director of the Institute of Space Sciences at the Free University of Berlin. Furrer was an avid pilot. He earned his pilot license in 1974, doing several long-distance trips with one engine planes - including a flight over the inland ice of Greenland in 1979 and a solo flight from Germany to Quito, Ecuador in 1981. His love for planes finally cost him his life, as he died in a plane crash after a flight show on the Johannisthal Air Field (Berlin). He was a passenger of pilot Gerd Kahdemann in a historic Bf 108 when the plane crashed shortly after 6:00 p.m. after performing a roll at low altitude.

"Roberto Donna is an Italian chef and restaurateur in Washington D.C. Donna was born in Turin, Italy, where he enrolled in culinary school at the age of 13. He came to the United States at the age of 19, working in an Italian restaurant on K Street in Washington, D.C. In 1984, Donna opened Galileo in Dupont Circle, which was an immediate success. The restaurant only seated 50, and in the early days, even Vice-President George H. W. Bush could not secure a last-minute reservation. Donna and his partner Savino Recine opened more casual trattorias, Primi Piatti, and then I Matti, serving pizza and pasta. By the end of the 1990s, Donna's empire grew to 12 restaurants, including Il Radicchio, Pesce, and Barolo. In 1999, he expanded Galileo into a neighboring space and opened a restaurant-within-a-restaurant, Il Laboratorio del Galileo, serving multi-course meals in a small (25-30 seats) dining room, with a glass-walled ""showcase"" kitchen. Donna published a cookbook, Cooking in Piedmont, in 1996. Donna won the 1996 James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic. The next year, Galileo was named one of the ""10 Best Italian Restaurants in America"" by Wine Spectator. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington recognized Donna as the ""Chef of the Year"" in 1990, and the ""Restaurateur of the Year"" in 1995. Donna was invited to Rome in 1996 to receive the Insegna del Ristorante Italiano, awarded by the Italian Government in recognition of serving the best authentic Italian food outside Italy. In 2005, Donna competed on Iron Chef America, losing to Masaharu Morimoto after failing to plate a sufficient number of dishes. He requested a rematch and bested Morimoto in 2006. In 2004, Donna's company declared bankruptcy and his restaurants began to close; Galileo closed in 2006, and he had no restaurants to his name when Bebo Trattoria closed in 2009. Donna was prosecuted for failing to pay taxes at Bebo, and in 2010, Donna pled guilty to felony embezzlement, receiving a five-year suspended sentence on condition of probation, good behavior, and restitution. Donna and his business partners still faced several civil lawsuits when he returned to the kitchen with the opening of Galileo III in October 2010. The restaurant closed abruptly after less than one year. In 2012, Donna opened Al Dente in Embassy Row, and Esquire magazine named him its ""Chef of the Year."" In February 2013, a four-seat counter, Roberto's 4, opened within Al Dente. At the end of 2013, Donna opened a second restaurant, Alba Osteria, in Mount Vernon Triangle. Alba Osteria closed in 2019, citing rent disagreements with its landlord. In February, 2022, Roberto’s opened in Vienna, Virginia, with Donna as chef, doing what he does best.

"David Bouley (born May 27, 1953, near Storrs, Connecticut) is an American chef with dual French citizenship. Sole owner and chef with restaurants in Tribeca, New York City. He is best known for his flagship restaurant, Bouley, synonymous with high standards, Nouveau Cuisine redefined in the guise of a lighter French paradigm for the highest density of food nutrition and community. Early in his career, Bouley worked in restaurants in Cape Cod, Santa Fe, New Mexico, and, eventually, France and Switzerland. While in Europe, after studies at the Sorbonne, he had the opportunity to work with chefs Roger Vergé, Paul Bocuse, Joël Robuchon, Gaston Lenôtre, Frédy Girardet, and Paul Haeberlin. Bouley returned to work in New York City in leading restaurants of the time, such as Le Cirque, Le Périgord, and La Côte Basque, as well as spending time as sous chef in a restaurant opened by Roger Vergé in San Francisco. In 1985, he became chef of Montrachet restaurant, awarded three stars in its first three weeks by the New York Times. In 1987 he became Chef/Owner of his namesake restaurant, ""Bouley,"" in TriBeCa overlooking Duane Park. The restaurant earned a four-star review in The New York Times and won over six James Beard Foundation awards which included Best Restaurant and Best Chef. In 2015, Bouley was awarded the ""Best Restaurant Award in the United States"" from TripAdvisor's Traveler's Choice Awards, ranking #14 in the world. Bouley also received a 29 out of 30 rating in Zagat for decades finishing with a 4.9 out of five in 2020. In 1991, Zagat's asked its 7,000 diners, ""Where you would you eat the last meal of your life?"" Respondents ""overwhelmingly"" chose Bouley. In 1997, Bouley restaurant moved location and opened up as the Bouley Bakery. In September 1999, Bouley opened Danube, a Viennese-inspired restaurant, located on Hudson Street, and authored his first book East of Paris: The New Cuisines of Austria and the Danube. Following the September 11 attacks, Bouley Bakery served as a base to feed rescue and relief workers at Ground Zero. Known as The Green Tarp, over one million meals for Ground Zero relief workers were prepared in conjunction with the Red Cross. Bouley Bakery re-opened to the general public in 2002. In 1999, Bouley Bakery earned four stars by The New York Times and two Michelin Stars before it changed locations in 2008 and was renamed Bouley Restaurant. His other restaurant, Danube, also received two Michelin stars. The Danube location was transformed into a new entity called Brushstroke Restaurant in 2011. Brushstroke Restaurant, located in TriBeCa, was a combined effort between Chef Bouley and the in Osaka, to share Japanese food culture and products while integrating American ingredients. It received two Michelin stars, becoming a leader in Kaiseki cuisine. Bouley Botanical, on another corner in TriBeCa, was an event space dedicated to cultivating nutrient-rich plants, served in the flagship Bouley Restaurant. It also served as an educational forum to develop creative healthy eating lifestyles through its lecture series: The Chef & The Doctor. Its inception in 2013 continues today on multiple platforms. Bouley Test Kitchen from 2005 to 2020 was a private event space and learning center for visiting guest chefs and for developing recipes for the Bouley enterprises. The facilities were used by the American Team for the Bocuse d'Or Competition 2011. In 2018 the Test Kitchen moved to the Flatiron District with a new entity Bouley at Home. Guests were seated at three long white counters created in conjunction with Bulthaup Kitchen design to showcase the methodology, building blocks, and techniques that define Bouley cuisine. In March of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bouley Test Kitchen closed and Bouley at Home moved back to TriBeCa serving as an R&D studio for his upcoming book Bouley at Home: Living Pantry. Dedicated to sharing pure and specialized limited cultivated products with his clientele, Bouley is one of the first chefs in America to create Tasting Menus. Since the 1980s his personalization of each customer’s likes and desires of specific ingredients is health-driven. It’s said that Bouley may not remember a customer’s name but knows exactly what they ate from a 12-course meal several years later. He is sought out by those with auto-immune challenges. This approach has won him Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University and the Rogosin Institute, an affiliate of New York-Presbyterian. In 2015 Bouley was the first non-Japanese citizen garnered the Japanese Cuisine (Washoku) Goodwill Ambassador, by the Japanese Government. Washoku means ""harmony of food"" and is associated with an essential spirit of respect for nature that is closely related to the sustainable use of natural resources. NHK’s 2019 documentary traces Bouley’s exploration of longevity through artisanal products and their growers, including doctors, biochemists, and nutritionists. Throughout 35 prefectures, A Magic of a Dish demonstrates and quantifies health benefits with a focus on fermented foods. Episodes continue to be added into 2022. Since the inception of his first restaurant, Bouley is dedicated to the use of pure ingredients and techniques to create “unbreakable health”. He is a pioneer in using organic, wild-caught, grass-fed, and finished or foraged products. Working with farmers to grow nutrient-dense herbs and vegetables, like the fingerling potatoes, as early as the 1980’s to the present. Chef Bouley was invited as a commencement speaker for the College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources at the University of Connecticut and an honorary degree recipient of Doctors and Humane Letters. In 2020, mid pandemic, the French Government bestowed upon Bouley the honor of the title of Knight in the Order of the agricultural Merit (Ordre du Mérite de l’Agriculture et de l’Alimentation). One of five categories of The Legion of Honor, it is the highest decoration in France: an order of merit bestowed for outstanding contributions to food and agriculture.

He soon became fascinated by the owner, Abraham García, a chef whose cooking reflects many of his personal interests, including literature, photography, minery, travel and art. These visits to the famous restaurant led David to go to catering college, where he began his further academic training.

"Homaro ""Omar"" Cantu Jr. (September 23, 1976 – April 14, 2015) was an American chef and inventor known for his use of molecular gastronomy. As a child, Cantu was fascinated with science and engineering. While working in a fast food restaurant, he discovered the similarities between science and cooking and decided to become a chef. In 1999, he was hired by his idol, Chicago chef Charlie Trotter. In 2003, Cantu became the first chef of Moto, which he later purchased. Through Moto, Cantu explored his unusual ideas about cooking including edible menus, carbonated fruit, and food cooked with a laser. Initially seen as a novelty only, Moto eventually earned critical praise and, in 2012, a Michelin star. Cantu's second restaurant, iNG, and his coffee house, Berrista, focused on the use of ""miracle berries"" to make sour food taste sweet. He was working on opening a brewery called Crooked Fork at the time of his suicide in 2015. In addition to being a chef, Cantu was a media personality, appearing regularly on TV shows, and an inventor. In 2010, he produced and co-hosted a show called Future Food. Through his media appearances, he advocated for an end to world hunger and thought his edible paper creation and the miracle berry could play a significant role in that goal. Cantu volunteered his time and money to a variety of charities and patented several food gadgets.",Chefs,"[('Roger Keith Crouch', 'PERSON'), ('September 12, 1940', 'DATE'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('1997', 'DATE')]","[('Roger Keith Crouch', 'PERSON'), ('September 12 , 1940', 'DATE'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('Space Shuttle', 'PRODUCT'), ('1997', 'DATE')]"
