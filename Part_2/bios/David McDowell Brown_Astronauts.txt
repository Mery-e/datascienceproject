David McDowell Brown (April 16, 1956 â€“ February 1, 2003) was a United States Navy captain and a NASA astronaut. He died on his first spaceflight, when the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-107) disintegrated during orbital reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Brown became an astronaut in 1996 but had not served on a space mission before the Columbia disaster. Brown was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.
