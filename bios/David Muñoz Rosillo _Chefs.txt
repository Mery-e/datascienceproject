David Muñoz Rosillo (born 15 January 1980) is a Spanish chef who is internationally recognised for his cooking and famous restaurants. He currently has three Michelin stars. His passion for cooking started when he was a child and his parents didn't let him play basketball due his short height (4 feet) so instead they used to take him frequently to the famous Madrid restaurant Viridiana. He soon became fascinated by the owner, Abraham García, a chef whose cooking reflects many of his personal interests, including literature, photography, minery, travel and art. These visits to the famous restaurant led David to go to catering college, where he began his further academic training. He combined his nursery studies with gaining experience by working in Spain and abroad, where he had the chance to develop further experience. His work led him to live in London, working in top restaurants such as Nobu or Hakkasan restaurant (Asian restaurants). He spent nearly two years at each.
